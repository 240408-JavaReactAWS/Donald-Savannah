# Description
The mayor of Gaithersburg in Maryland would like to know the number of pets by 
species and the total number of pet in his city. To do so, he has met professional developers to buid an application that will be used
to collect the data. He has instructed a group of 10 people by zipcode to conduct the survey by where the software will be used by them
for data collection.

Using Spring Boot, the developers will create a simple API for data collection on pets. The goal is be to build an API that allows the team to store these data and track them as needed.

## Requirements
- Build the application using at least Java 17 and Spring Boot 3

- All interactions between a User and the API should happen via HTTP Requests. Using a tool like Postman will allow you to set up these requests.

- All data should be stored in a SQL Database using an in-memory H2 database for data persistance.

    - As a user, I can create a new Item
    - As a user, I can view all Items
    - As a user, I can create an account to hold my Items
    - As a user, I can login to my account (which is stored in the database)
