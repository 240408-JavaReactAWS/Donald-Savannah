A restful application that collect data on pets

# Description
The mayor of Gaithersburg in Maryland would like to know the number of pets by 
species and the total number of pet in his city. To do so, he has met with professional developers to buid an application that will be used
to collect the data. He has instructed a group of 10 people by zipcode to conduct the survey by where the software will be used by them
for data collection.

Using Spring Boot, the developers will create a simple API for data collection on pets. The goal is to build an API that allows the team to store these data and track them as needed.

## Requirements
- Build the application using at least Java 17 and Spring Boot 3

- All interactions between a User and the API should happen via HTTP Requests. Using a tool like Postman will allow you to set up these requests.

- All data should be stored in a SQL Database using PostgreSQL for data persistance.

    - As a user, I can add a pet
    - As a user, I can view all pets
    - As a user, I can create an account
    - As a user, I can login to my account
